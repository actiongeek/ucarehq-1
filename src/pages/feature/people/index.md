## People first

Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile or other, today’s devices allow us to work in all manner of places. By having access to people’s profiles from wherever makes means you can get on with your job while ensuring the team all have access to the same up-to-date info.

## All your people stored safely in one place

Whether you have just a few people or thousands, you can see everything that’s going on at once. Quickly find or add people’s contact info, address, important dates, relationships and groups. Send bulk personalized email and SMS messages, add secure notes or assign a team member to follow them up all potentially on the go. And just like the real world you can group people by household which helps you gain a better understanding of each family unit. Be they a household of singles, newlyweds or mom; dad and three kids?
