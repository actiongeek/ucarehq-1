## Stay organized & help build connections

Your church has a lot going on that your team needs to manage. Groups are for organizing any list of people, be it a list of people with certain gifting’s, recent visitors, small groups, classes, ministries, campuses, the entire church and more.

## Make it a perfect fit

Instead of having to set up your ministries in a fixed structure, Groups are flexible to let you model your church structure. Either compile lists of people into groups or quickly select multiple criteria to create search groups. You can then send personalized bulk email & SMS to an entire group, perform bulk updates to group members, manage group leaders or view one of the reports.

## Simple yet powerful

Search group auto-update based on the criteria you select, in doing so they let you build almost any people report that your church may need. As examples you can create a list of recent visitors, birthdays, age specific groups, absent people, all your regular women, all the people at a particular campus, etc. If you're ever unsure how to create the search you need then our team is ready and waiting to help.

## Track all attendance

You can also [track attendance](/features/attendance-tracking/) of any of your groups. Small group leaders receive reminders that allow them to complete attendance reports on the spot with a few taps. The kids or youth team can use check-in to quickly & securely know who they have in their care and where they are located. Your hosting teams can also track attendance of individuals, headcounts, giving and other stats using the mobile app.
