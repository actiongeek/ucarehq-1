## Set up shop

Wouldn’t it be great if your attendees could easily buy resources at your church? And wouldn’t it also be great if people could quickly grab all your conference sessions from your website or the latest worship album in your church app?

## Sell in person and online

UCare will process payments, issue receipts and track stock levels. UCare will also distribute digital products and manage the process of shipping physical items. You can even create a store for your cafe so you can see all the coffee orders, and use an easy order management board to ensure that orders are made to plan and on time.
