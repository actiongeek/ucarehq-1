## Why should you do all the work?

Running surveys or keeping your growing database up to date can be very time consuming, meaning it often doesn’t happen. Imagine if you could create a form with just the info you need, then drop it on your website, share on Facebook or send it in an email, your workload just went down. Connect the forms to processes and you can start to automate much of the follow-up while ensuring people don’t get forgotten, your workload just went way down!

## Try this example form

This is an example form that's linked to a process. The process sends you an automated response if you enter your details. While a simple example this has had the colors customized and gives an idea of even more sophisticated forms you could create.

## Still more form options
