The new online portal provides an easy way to give members of your church a way to register for events, small groups and to fill in forms. They can also give, purchase resources, update their contact details, and browse the church directory all from the online portal

UCare contains options to embed most of these options into your main church website, but this has a few issues for some churches. First, you need someone who knows how to modify your existing website to add the integration points. Second, many of these options are sending sensitive personal or credit card payment over the internet. As such, your website should be running on HTTPS to keep this data secure. If these issues seem too much for your skills, or you just want to get the online experience set up as quickly as possible, then the portal is for you.

Here are a brief outline of what you can display in the portal, check out [mychurch.ucareapp.com/portal](https://mychurch.ucareapp.com/portal) for a simple example of what you can do or view the help article [Changing portal settings](https://ucare.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204759274-Changing-portal-settings).
